# **Arweave’s Perpetual Open Web Hackathon**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the perpetual, open permaweb hackathon!

At Arweave we firmly believe that the future of the [new web should be open source](https://medium.com/@arweave/towards-an-open-source-web-9ffe201fc044) for the benefit of users and developers alike. We want to help make this a reality, so we’re rewarding developers like yourself for building open source dApps on the permaweb!

The Arweave itself is a global, permanent hard drive. The permaweb is a decentralised, immutable web built on top of the Arweave. Permaweb apps are built using normal web technologies — HTML, CSS, and Javascript — but are deployed to Arweave’s on-chain storage system, making them permanent and available in a fast, decentralised manner. You can get started and deploy a permaweb app in 2 minutes or less.

**Time investment:** One afternoon to one weekend.

**Please note that ALL submissions require approval via the [Discord Open Web Hackathon channel](https://discord.gg/ZdGZ8E29Sr).**

## **Reward**

**$250 in ETH + $50 in AR**
A dynamic and interactive web application that is hosted on the permaweb, along with ideas that contribute added functionality to the permaweb eco system. For example: [Arweave API explorer](https://arweave.net/LHff4F45o7ipDqjoePG0PDG5BD2hLD8xf17OBg4FjRE) & [ArweaveID](https://arweave.net/fGUdNmXFmflBMGI2f9vD7KzsrAc1s1USQgQLgAVT0W0). Ideas that resemble or improve on popular web applications such as [AskWeave](https://arweave.net/HhIjOjxgHYXJU5RVjRYfAR017vbZdujbCSlaA8NQ20U) & [Scribe](https://arweave.net/VOKAC_SYiUzbJrEaIY5SEBh1pf0bGQOd8c7G68nzet4#/) are also encouraged, and all applications must include a nice looking UI. Applications whose core features rely on centralised dependencies are not accepted. 

## **Resources**

You can find the docs for getting started deploying your first permaweb app [here](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/tools/textury-arkb).

The docs for the JS library that allows you to read from and write to the permaweb are [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-js).

ArConnect wallet API docs can be found [here](https://docs.th8ta.org/arconnect/functions). 

Arweave.app wallet source files can be found [here](https://github.com/jfbeats/ArweaveWebWallet).

We’re providing some free tokens so you can get started building and deploying - grab your wallet [here](https://tokens.arweave.org/#/wallet). For guidance on how to use Arweave web wallets, check out [this user guide](https://docs.arweave.org/info/wallets/arweave-wallet).

## **Rules**

**[Check out ArweaveApps](http://arweaveapps.com) to ensure your submission is substantially different from existing applications on the permaweb!**

### **Successful submissions will meet the following criteria:**

- Submissions must be **your own original work**, and must be **unique or substantially different** from other permaweb applications or submissions to this hackathon
- We are happy to accept forks of other applications, but the featureset must be substantially different or significantly expanded in the forked version
Your app **_must_ interact with Arweave** using ArweaveJS
- Your app **must** include either [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) or [Arweave.app](https://arweave.app/) wallet integration - keyfile drag & drop login ***will not*** be accepted
- Apps must be **open source, with the full source code available on Github or another open code hosting repository**. Feel free to use whatever OSS licence you prefer
- Applications should be **sufficiently complex**, as judged by the core Arweave team. For example, a simple ‘hello world’ app is not complex enough to receive a reward. Broken/non-functional submissions will also be rejected. You should aim for a minimal viable product that an end-user could reasonably start to use
- Your submission must **include a link to a live, functioning, and running instance of the app itself, as well as a link to the repository** it is stored within (see the submission process below)
- All applicants must **[join our Discord Dev server](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm)** and share your  submission in the **#on-the-arweave** channel upon completion
- Your GitHub account **must be at least one month old**
- All submissions must include a **brief description** of the application and functionality in the GitHub repo

## **Reward details**

- We are currently offering rewards for up to 500 successful submissions in this hackathon
- The value of ETH and AR to USD will be pegged at the time of transfer, which follows successful submission and provision of recipients’ ETH and AR addresses
- Only submissions which are judged by the core Arweave team to meet all of the submission criteria will receive the rewards

## **The submission process**

Please note, submissions will only receive a reward if they successfully meet the submission criteria listed above. If you have questions, [holla at us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm)

- Hack! Join us our tech Discord if you have any questions!
- Publish your app and submit a comment to the GitHub issue for the hackathon campaign [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/issues/1), containing a link to your app’s repository, and a link to the live, running version of your app on the permaweb. You can generate a permaweb URL for the app by appending the transaction ID to this gateway link: [https://arweave.net/](https://arweave.net/)
- If your app meets the reward criteria defined above, we will release the reward!

Remember to join us on our developers’ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/VxJ3xsm) to chat, and get feedback and assistance with building!
